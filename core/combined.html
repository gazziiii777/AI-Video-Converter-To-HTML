        <p>The Prusa Core One is an enclosed CoreXY 3D printer with a 250×220×270mm build volume. The Prusa Core One
                features an all-steel exoskeleton frame for stability and active chamber temperature control that
                reaches 55°C.
                The Prusa Core One prints at higher speeds than previous Prusa models while maintaining quality across
                materials
                including PLA, PETG, ASA, PC, and Nylon. This is achieved through factory-tuned print profiles for over
                200
                different filaments.</p>
        <p>The Prusa Core One uses the Nextruder extruder system with 360° cooling that enables printing 75° overhangs
                without supports. This extruder system works alongside multiple sensors for automatic functionality. For
                example, the Prusa Core One includes a load cell for first-layer calibration, dual filament sensors for
                material
                detection, five thermistors for temperature monitoring, and a door sensor. Due to this comprehensive
                setup, the
                Prusa Core One requires only 10 minutes from unpacking to first print, guided by a step-by-step
                initialization
                process.</p>
        <p>The Prusa Core One integrates with Prusa's complete ecosystem while maintaining offline functionality. This
                ecosystem includes PrusaSlicer software with one-click printing, Prusa Connect for remote management,
                and the
                Prusa App for mobile control. Through these connections, the Prusa Core One provides access to
                Printables.com
                with its library of 3D models. For long-term value, the Prusa Core One offers backward compatibility for
                accessories like print sheets and nozzles from previous models. Additionally, the Prusa Core One
                supports future
                expansions including Multi-Material Upgrade (MMU3) compatibility for printing with up to five filaments
                simultaneously.</p>

        <p>The Prusa Core One prints with layer heights from 0.05mm to 0.30mm. The Prusa Core One achieves this
                precision
                through a CoreXY kinematic system with 0.9° stepper motors that reduce vertical fine artifacts (VFAs) on
                print
                surfaces. This reduction in VFAs results in smoother finished objects. The Prusa Core One incorporates
                the
                Nextruder's 360° cooling system, which enables printing of 75° overhangs without supports. This cooling
                capability maintains dimensional accuracy while reducing material waste during printing.</p>
        <p>The Prusa Core One is Prusa's fastest printer due to three key components working together. For example, the
                Prusa Core One combines CoreXY kinematics, high-flow CHT (Compressed Heat Transmission) nozzle, and
                built-in
                Input Shaper technology. These components maintain print quality at higher speeds than previous Prusa
                models. To
                ensure consistent results, the Prusa Core One uses load cell-based automatic bed leveling that probes
                only the
                specific print area required. This targeted probing saves time while ensuring perfect first layers. Due
                to this
                probing system, users don't need to adjust Z-offset when switching between different build plates.</p>
        <p>The mechanical design of the Prusa Core One features an all-steel exoskeleton frame for stability during
                rapid
                movements. This frame construction minimizes vibrations that could affect print quality. For precise
                height
                control, the Prusa Core One implements a Z-axis with three independent stepper motors. At the rear of
                the
                printer, two exhaust fans automatically adjust speed based on chamber temperature requirements.
                Additionally,
                the Prusa Core One includes phase stepping for smoother motor operation and fan motor monitoring to
                detect
                potential cooling issues before they affect prints.</p>
        <p>In controlled testing, the Prusa Core One produces consistent glossy surface finishes throughout prints,
                particularly with technical materials. The enclosed chamber of the Prusa Core One reaches temperatures
                up to
                55°C and maintains this thermal stability during printing. When printing a test benchy model, the Prusa
                Core One
                completes the print in 37 minutes while maintaining accurate time estimates on the display. This
                accuracy in
                time estimation makes print scheduling predictable. For high-temperature materials, the temperature
                regulation
                system automatically preheats the chamber before starting prints, ensuring proper layer adhesion from
                the first
                layer onward.</p>

        <h2>Which filament materials can you use with the Prusa Core One?</h2>
        <p>The Prusa Core One supports these materials without additional accessories: PLA, PETG, Flex, PVA, PC, PP,
                CPE,
                and PVB. The Prusa Core One can also handle ABS, ASA, HIPS, and PA (Nylon) when equipped with the
                optional
                Advanced Filtration System. To accommodate these materials, the Prusa Core One's hot end reaches
                temperatures up
                to 290°C, and the heated bed operates up to 120°C. This temperature range enables printing across all
                these
                material types effectively.</p>
        <p>The Prusa Core One features an enclosed chamber that creates optimal conditions for technical materials. For
                high-temperature filaments, the Prusa Core One automatically preheats the chamber to 40°C before
                starting
                prints. During operation, this chamber temperature reaches up to 55°C, which prevents warping and layer
                separation in materials like ABS and ASA. For lower-temperature materials such as PLA, the Prusa Core
                One
                maintains chamber temperatures between 20-30°C. This temperature control is achieved using two exhaust
                fans that
                adjust speed automatically. Additionally, the top panel of the Prusa Core One includes a manual vent
                that opens
                for PLA printing and closes for high-temperature materials.</p>
        <p>The Prusa Core One works with any standard 1.75mm filament from third-party manufacturers. Prusa also offers
                their own Prusament line with 200+ pre-configured material profiles in PrusaSlicer for the Prusa Core
                One. To
                enhance material compatibility, the Prusa Core One's hardware includes specific features. For example,
                the Prusa
                Core One uses a planetary gearbox with 10:1 ratio for flexible filaments and dual filament sensors (one
                at entry
                and one at the hot end). The Prusa Core One comes with a high-flow Compressed Heat Transmission (CHT)
                brass
                nozzle for standard materials. This stock brass nozzle handles non-abrasive materials, while optional
                hardened
                steel nozzles are available for carbon fiber-reinforced filaments. For convenience, the nozzle change
                system
                allows users to switch between nozzle types without requiring hot tightening.</p>

        <h2>What is the build volume of the Prusa Core One?</h2>
        <p>The Prusa Core One has a build volume of 250 × 220 × 270 mm (9.8 × 8.6 × 10.6 inches). The Prusa Core One's
                build
                volume represents a 30% increase in total print volume compared to the previous Prusa i3 Mark 4S (MK4S)
                printer.
                This increase comes from the Prusa Core One adding 10 mm to the Y-axis and 50 mm to the Z-axis while
                maintaining
                the same 250 mm width on the X-axis as the MK4S.</p>
        <p>The Prusa Core One has external dimensions of 415 × 444 × 555 mm (16.3 × 17.5 × 21.8 inches). The Prusa Core
                One
                is 50% smaller than an MK4S with an enclosure despite providing more print volume. This space efficiency
                is
                achieved through the compact CoreXY design that eliminates the moving bed found in i3-style printers.
                Additionally, the sides of the Prusa Core One feature recessed pockets. These recessed pockets reduce
                interior
                volume while providing space for the spool holder and storage.</p>

                </tr>
        </table>
        <p>The Prusa Core One's build volume suits specific applications in various settings. For example, the increased
                Z-height allows printing taller objects like vases, architectural models, and cosplay props. The build
                plate of
                the Prusa Core One uses the same Mark 52 heated bed (MK52) system as the MK4S. This compatibility
                ensures that
                existing print sheets work with the Prusa Core One. For print farm operations, the compact footprint
                with larger
                build volume provides significant benefits. Prusa's own print farm contains over 600 machines, and due
                to the
                space-efficient design of the Prusa Core One, more printers can fit in the same area, thereby increasing
                production capacity.</p>

        <h2>What printer controls are available on the Prusa Core One?</h2>
        <p>The Prusa Core One features a 3.5-inch graphic 65k color touchscreen with a rotary dial interface for
                navigation.
                The Prusa Core One's screen mounts on a magnetic panel that detaches if the printer is tilted,
                preventing
                display damage. For status indication, the Prusa Core One includes an LED strip on the front edge of the
                build
                plate. This LED strip displays different colors to show printer status: idle, printing, warning, or
                error.
                Through the touchscreen interface, users access direct operation functions. These functions include
                filament
                loading/unloading, print job controls (start/pause/stop), and manual Z-offset adjustments during first
                layer
                printing.</p>
        <p>The Prusa Core One provides multiple calibration tools through the on-device interface. During initial setup,
                the
                Prusa Core One runs a self-test sequence that verifies component functionality. For consistent print
                quality,
                the Prusa Core One implements an automatic bed leveling system. This bed leveling system uses a load
                cell sensor
                to measure the build surface before each print, which eliminates the need for manual Z-offset
                adjustments when
                switching print sheets. From the display, users can control additional settings. For example, users can
                adjust
                chamber temperature settings, disable the door sensor that pauses prints when opened, and access
                maintenance
                functions. To ensure reliable printing, the Prusa Core One automatically detects filament presence using
                two
                sensors: one sensor at the filament entry point and another sensor at the extruder.</p>

        <hr />
        <h2>What connectivity options are available on the Prusa Core One?</h2>
        <p>The Prusa Core One provides three primary connection methods: Ethernet port for wired network access,
                detachable
                ESP Wi-Fi module, and USB port for direct drive access. The Prusa Core One's Wi-Fi module can be
                physically
                disconnected for environments requiring heightened security. This disconnection still maintains full
                printer
                functionality through the other connection methods. For initial setup, the Prusa Core One includes an
                NFC (Near
                Field Communication) reader on the back panel. This NFC reader transfers network credentials from a
                smartphone
                to the printer with a simple tap.</p>
        <p>The Prusa Core One operates with both local and cloud network protocols. Prusa Link allows connection through
                the
                local network without internet dependency, while Prusa Connect provides cloud-based remote access with
                additional features. Both these services work with PrusaSlicer software for direct print file
                transmission. The
                Prusa Core One is compatible with computers through web browsers and with mobile devices. This
                compatibility
                extends to the dedicated Prusa App for iOS and Android. For monitoring capabilities, an optional USB-C
                camera
                ($40) mounts in the upper left corner of the print chamber. The USB-C camera connects directly to the
                Prusa Core
                One's motherboard but requires an active Wi-Fi connection and Prusa Connect service to function. This
                connection
                requirement exists because the camera does not stream video through the local network.</p>

        <h2>What software is offered with the Prusa Core One?</h2>
        <p>The Prusa Core One uses PrusaSlicer as its primary software interface. PrusaSlicer is an open-source slicing
                software that comes with 200+ pre-configured filament profiles tested in-house. PrusaSlicer offers both
                basic
                one-click printing and advanced customization options. These customization options include layer height
                adjustment (0.05-0.30mm), infill type selection, and speed settings. For the Prusa Core One
                specifically,
                PrusaSlicer includes features such as chamber temperature control with minimum and nominal temperature
                settings
                for different materials. To connect with the printer, PrusaSlicer integrates through two methods: Prusa
                Link for
                local network connection and Prusa Connect for cloud-based control.</p>
        <p>Prusa Connect provides remote printer management capabilities for the Prusa Core One. Prusa Connect works
                through
                web browsers and the Prusa App (available for iOS and Android). Through Prusa Connect, users can access
                several
                functions. For example, Prusa Connect enables print file uploading, job queuing, real-time monitoring,
                and
                status notifications. The Prusa App also integrates with Printables.com, which allows direct sending of
                pre-sliced files to the Prusa Core One. For maintenance purposes, the Prusa Core One's firmware can be
                updated
                through three different methods: USB drive loading, Prusa Connect, or the Prusa Mobile App. All this
                software is
                provided without subscription fees. Additionally, the firmware is open-source and modifiable, with Prusa
                honoring warranty coverage even when using custom firmware. When using the optional USB-C camera ($40)
                with the
                Prusa Core One, this camera works exclusively with Prusa Connect. This camera captures images at 0.1
                frames per
                second (one image every 10 seconds) rather than streaming continuous video.</p>

                includes polycarbonate panels that attach with plastic rivets. The frame of the Prusa Core One features
                orange-colored accents on the door handle, knob, and select internal components. For maintenance and
                modification, the enclosure panels are not glued, allowing complete disassembly with standard
                screwdrivers.</p>
        <p>The Prusa Core One incorporates functional design elements for practical use. For space efficiency, the Prusa
                Core One includes two recessed side pockets that reduce interior volume while providing utility. One of
                these
                pockets houses the filament spool holder while the other offers storage space. For flexibility in
                positioning,
                the front door opens 180° and can be configured to hinge from either left or right side. To prevent
                damage, a
                magnetic mount secures the display panel, detaching if the printer is tilted. For temperature
                management, the
                top panel features a manual sliding vent when printing different materials. As a visual indicator, an
                LED strip
                on the front edge of the bed displays printer status through color coding: idle, printing, warning, or
                error.
        </p>
        <p>The Prusa Core One uses a CoreXY motion system with 0.9° stepper motors on X and Y axes. This motor choice
                reduces vertical fine artifacts in printed objects. For precision movement, the X-axis rides on a linear
                rail
                mounted to a steel extrusion, while the Y-axis uses 10mm smooth rods. For Z-axis movement, the Prusa
                Core One
                employs three independent stepper motors with 8mm smooth rods. This CoreXY design eliminates the moving
                bed
                found in i3-style printers, which increases stability at higher speeds. For heat resistance and
                durability,
                internal structural components use 3D-printed carbon fiber polycarbonate blend parts rather than
                standard PETG.
                To secure the extruder system, the print head mounts to the X-axis rail via an aluminum adapter plate
                that holds
                the Nextruder with its planetary gearbox.</p>

        <p>The Core One's steel enclosure panels work with magnets for attaching accessories. Community-developed
                modifications include filament dry boxes for the side recess, tool holders for the left pocket, and air
                filtration adapters for third-party filters. These designs are available on Printables.com, Prusa's 3D
                model
                repository. The printer uses standard components, enabling third-party replacement parts and upgrades.

        <h2>How reliable is the Prusa Core One and what maintenance does it require?</h2>
        <p>The Prusa Core One uses an all-steel frame construction with linear rails for the X-axis and 10mm smooth rods
                for
                the Y-axis. The Prusa Core One's internal structural components are printed in carbon fiber
                polycarbonate blend
                for heat resistance and durability. For long-term serviceability, Prusa maintains part availability for
                their
                printers years after release. To demonstrate machine longevity, Prusa operates a print farm with over
                600
                printers in high-volume production environments. This real-world testing validates the durability of the
                Prusa
                Core One under intensive use conditions.</p>
        <p>Maintenance on the Prusa Core One is simplified through integrated monitoring systems. For material tracking,
                the
                Prusa Core One includes dual filament sensors located at the entry point and extruder. For temperature
                monitoring, the printer uses five thermistors positioned across different components. For cooling system
                verification, the Prusa Core One features fan motor monitoring to detect issues. Before starting prints,
                automatic nozzle cleaning routines check for extrusion blockages. To eliminate manual calibration
                adjustments,
                the Prusa Core One employs a load cell-based bed leveling system. For maintenance access, all mechanical
                parts
                can be reached by removing the enclosure panels with their plastic rivets. Complete disassembly of the
                Prusa
                Core One requires only standard screwdrivers.</p>
        <p>These features reduce downtime through preventive detection systems. When issues occur, such as filament
                runout
                or temperature anomalies, the Prusa Core One automatically pauses and sends notifications. For repairs,
                the
                Prusa Core One uses standard components rather than proprietary designs. This standardization enables
                component-level repairs. For example, if a stepper motor fails, users can replace just that motor rather
                than
                entire motion assemblies. For software maintenance, the Prusa Core One's firmware updates through three
                methods:
                USB drive, Prusa Connect, or the Prusa Mobile App. These update options allow security fixes and feature
                improvements without specialized tools. For troubleshooting assistance, Prusa provides 24/7 technical
                support
                through live chat and email in multiple languages.</p>

        <h2>What support and warranty come with the Prusa Core One?</h2>
        <p>Prusa Research provides 24/7 customer support for the Prusa Core One through live chat and email in multiple
                languages. Prusa Research's support covers setup assistance, troubleshooting, and operational guidance.
                To
                complement this direct support, Prusa Research offers multiple support resources. These support
                resources
                include the printed 3D Printing Handbook packaged with the printer, online documentation on the Prusa
                Research
                website, and instructional content through Prusa Academy.</p>
        <p>The Prusa Core One includes warranty coverage for manufacturing defects and hardware failures. This warranty
                covers replacement parts or repairs needed due to these defects. For clarity on coverage limitations,
                the Prusa
                Core One warranty excludes consumable parts such as print sheets due to normal wear. However, if these
                print
                sheets arrive defective upon delivery, they are covered under warranty. Additionally, the warranty
                explicitly
                does not cover cosmetic damage including scratches, dents, and cracks. For user flexibility, Prusa
                Research
                honors warranty coverage even when users install custom firmware or modify the Prusa Core One.</p>
        <p>Prusa Research maintains an official forum where Prusa Core One users share knowledge and solutions. For
                ongoing
                improvement, Prusa Research releases regular firmware updates to enhance functionality and fix issues.
                These
                firmware updates are distributed through three channels: USB drive, Prusa Connect, or the Prusa Mobile
                App. To
                demonstrate long-term commitment, Prusa Research has a track record of supporting older printer models
                with
                firmware updates for 7+ years after release. For example, the Prusa Mark III received a firmware update
                in late
                2024, seven years after its initial release. This update history provides evidence that Prusa Research
                will
                continue supporting the Prusa Core One with improvements long after purchase.</p>

        <h2>How much does the Prusa Core One cost?</h2>
        <p>The Prusa Core One is available in two configurations: a fully assembled version ready to use out of the box
                [price_product /], and a kit version that costs approximately 18% less than the assembled model. The kit
                version
                includes all necessary components and tools but requires user assembly. Both versions offer identical
                print
                quality and features, with the price difference reflecting only the assembly labor. The assembled
                version
                arrives fully tested and calibrated by Prusa's quality control team, requiring minimal setup - just
                attaching
                the screen and installing rubber feet before printing. For customers who already own a Prusa MK4S, an
                upgrade
                kit is available at approximately 38% of the price of a full Core One kit, allowing conversion of the
                existing
                printer into a Core One while reusing compatible components. All versions include the same accessories:
                one
                smooth PEI print sheet, a 1kg spool of Prusament Galaxy Black PLA, and full documentation. Optional
                accessories
                like the chamber camera, advanced filtration system, and specialized nozzles are priced separately.</p>
