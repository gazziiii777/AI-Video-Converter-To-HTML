1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,940
 Better late than never, in terms of me uploading a new video, and for Prusa to introduce an

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,800
 affordable CoreXY printer with the Core One.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,400
 Let me get it out of the way that I paid for this myself, and I didn't get it earlier

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,340
 than anyone else.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,160
 I was in the first batch of shipments, and I've had it since February 4th.

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,500
 Now I've printed PLA, PETG, ABS, infused filament, and TPU on this, and it basically hasn't

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,680
 stopped printing since I got it.

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,740
 If you've ever watched one of my reviews, you know I don't like to spend a lot of time

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,580
 on all the features.

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,380
 I just want to show you guys what I find most important, which is how it prints.

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,320
 But let me quickly go over some stuff I do like.

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,800
 I really like that the cardboard packaging has built-in handles to easily pull it out

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,740
 of the box, and then you can roll it out of the packaging and get set up, and it was

14
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,680
 so quick and easy to get this thing printed.

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,780
 I like that the plate on the front is magnetic, so if you tip it forward, it just magnets

16
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,800
 off and doesn't break.

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,520
 I like that unlike the Mark 4S, you can actually see the nozzle in the first layer, and

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,200
 the case light is right at where the nozzle will be printing, so it's easy to see.

19
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,200
 I really like that the entire thing is steel, which avoids the bi-metallic effect of having

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,020
 different metals with different expansion rates.

21
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,380
 As the rat rig guys, hell that's going.

22
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,900
 Now I want to mention some stuff I don't really like.

23
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,600
 I'm not the biggest fan of the way that this top vent is.

24
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,640
 I wish it wasn't just a manual little slider.

25
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,320
 It's not that big of a deal, but I do wish it was different.

26
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,300
 The top is also very bendy, so if you put stuff on it, it'll sag a little bit.

27
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,700
 I'm not the biggest fan of the way the nozzle swaps are.

28
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,660
 On the Mark 4, there's a handy little tool that'll grip the heat block for you so you

29
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,520
 can pull the nozzle out.

30
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,920
 I'm sure that something like that is being worked on with the core one, but for now you

31
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,500
 kind of just have to do it all with your hand.

32
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,760
 It's not a big deal again, but it's something I want to know.

33
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,960
 Now there really isn't much that I dislike about this printer, but this one deserves

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,100
 maybe a special mention because I like and dislike it.

35
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,540
 The way that this printer is made, I can still use my plates from my Mark 3 from a few

36
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,860
 years ago, which is what is loaded in here right now, which is incredible.

37
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,500
 That they were able to keep the compatibility for all their printers going forward.

38
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,040
 Hell, even right now they actively sell kits on their website to take a Mark 3 and turn

39
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,140
 it into a core one.

40
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,220
 That's awesome.

41
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:13,320
 But I think the thing that annoys me the most is even though we got the bigger area

42
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:19,200
 of the on the plate that you can print on, even though it's the same plate, it's still

43
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,740
 a relatively small printer, especially when you compare it in the wide dimension to

44
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,320
 like the X1 and the P1.

45
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:31,160
 You have 36 more millimeters on those printers and lots of companies are producing even bigger

46
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,540
 machines than this, which hey, I get it.

47
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:39,780
 The XL is a thing that exists, but the main draw of the XL is that it's a tool changer.

48
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,840
 And I'm not saying that the core one is a bad printer by any stretch of the imagination.

49
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:50,120
 But what I hope to see is that the core one is the evolution of the Mark line.

50
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:57,720
 We eventually see the core one, a core one L that's like 280 millimeters cubed or 300 cubed.

51
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,300
 And then the XL is there at 360 millimeters cubed.

52
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,700
 So now let me hop off my soapbox and let's look at how this thing prints.

53
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,160
 Now you'll see that I have some prints from the Mark 4, the Mark 4 S, the X1 and the core

54
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,620
 one of course.

55
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,280
 You can see I did all these with the default settings and I noted where I changed the

56
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,680
 settings.

57
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:24,140
 I like to do these tests as default as possible because that's what someone who isn't as deep

58
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,180
 into how printers work will probably use.

59
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,540
 And if you know enough to change the settings, then you probably aren't concerned with watching

60
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,780
 some doofus on YouTube.

61
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,000
 Weak it up.

62
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:38,180
 Let's start with PLA because that is usually printed the fastest and requires the most

63
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,780
 cooling, which allows us to benchmark the tool head.

64
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,920
 I printed these three models, some of which you've seen before, like the Cali Dragon and

65
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,120
 this rock face test and this overhang test that I personally designed.

66
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,760
 Let's start with the Cali Dragon.

67
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,780
 I go through this section pretty fast, so pause to check things out if you want to.

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,400
 I don't want to do too much exposition.

69
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,900
 I just kind of want you guys to form your own conclusions.

70
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,940
 The Mark 4 non-S is included here, mostly as a control because it has kind of bad cooling.

71
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,820
 And you'll also see that the Mark 4 S kind of does the best in all of these.

72
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,340
 It's funny because the core one has the same tool head and cooling, but the Mark 4 S kind

73
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:13,860
 of beat it out.

74
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,560
 You'll see that the core one and the X1C, they're really very similar, especially in their

75
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,420
 overhang performance and their extrusion consistency.

76
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,700
 An important thing to remember is that this rock face has parts that are printed just

77
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,900
 in mid-air, so it's impossible to print it perfectly.

78
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,960
 But you can see that the Mark 4 S, the core one and the X1C do a pretty good job.

79
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,620
 Again, in my opinion, I would say the Mark 4 S is the best here.

80
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,100
 It does it the best job of like freezing those extrusions in mid-air.

81
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,920
 But overall, I don't have anything bad to say about any of these printers.

82
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,040
 Now let's move on to the real torture test.

83
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,580
 This is a model that I designed that accurately tests overhangs.

84
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,460
 I want to make an entire video on this topic, but the long and short of it is that most

85
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,520
 people talk about overhangs incorrectly.

86
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,220
 I constantly hear about overhangs as a degree value, even in prusas on marketing you can

87
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:18,580
 see that.

88
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,340
 But their own slicer tells you how they're actually calculated.

89
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,080
 If we read the tool tips for the overhang speed in prusa slicer, overhang size is expressed

90
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,180
 as a percentage of overlap of the extrusion with the previous layer.

91
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,240
 100% would be full overlap, no overhang.

92
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,080
 And I drew a little model for you right here where this is the layer that is already printed.

93
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,460
 This is the layer that you are printing.

94
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,180
 This percentage is the overhang.

95
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:58,560
 So overhangs are a percent of how much the layer being put down is overhanging the previous

96
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:58,940
 layer.

97
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:05,460
 This model takes into account the layer height and width in does 50, 40, 30, 20 and 10%

98
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,700
 not degree overhangs.

99
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,940
 The math is all done in fusion and a model is created for a specific layer height and

100
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,300
 width.

101
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,560
 This model truly tests a printer's ability to do overhangs.

102
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,780
 Now with all of that out of the way, let's check it out.

103
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,760
 Again, I'm using the Mark IV as just kind of a control as a printer that doesn't necessarily

104
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,680
 have the best cooling.

105
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,620
 I would say all of these printers do a pretty decent job up to 30%.

106
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:36,380
 But the thing is here, the Mark IV S beats out the other three printers by like a long

107
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:36,720
 shot.

108
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,280
 It is definitely the best performing printer here.

109
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:46,440
 I would say the X1C can't handle those 10% as good as the core one can, but you can

110
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,280
 see that there is a little bit more consistency in the overhang performance of the X1.

111
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,780
 If you noticed in my spreadsheet, I did the prints on the X1 with the door open and

112
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,000
 the top off, which on the core one, I did it with the door closed and the top open.

113
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,220
 And the chamber hovered around 30 Celsius in my 23 Celsius room.

114
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,140
 I did go ahead and run it again with the door open.

115
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,980
 Honestly, this one doesn't really look that much better.

116
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,160
 I don't think the door open is really necessary to get good overhang performance on this printer.

117
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,640
 I don't think it's the limiting factor.

118
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:22,180
 The next thing we can look at is ABS or ASA prints, which require a higher chamber temperature

119
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,380
 of 50C+.

120
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:28,960
 I have some comparisons with the X1 and the plus 4, which remember the plus 4 has a heated

121
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,620
 chamber, actively heated chamber.

122
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,640
 The X1 was preheated for about 30 minutes and hit 40 Celsius chamber temp.

123
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:39,780
 And the core 1 was set to a 40C minimum temp and took about 23 minutes to start the print.

124
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,560
 And by the time those 23 minutes were up, it was already at the minimum of 40C for about

125
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,140
 10 minutes.

126
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,260
 So it was actually at 47C by time it started printing the prime line.

127
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:54,520
 This part was printed on the core 1 and all of these parts were printed in polymaker ASA.

128
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,760
 And you actually can see that there's a bit of VFA here.

129
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:05,300
 You can see it a lot right there, but this part did not warp at all due to the core 1's

130
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,960
 chamber temperature, which is really nice.

131
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,860
 You see this is nice and board flat.

132
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,120
 And if I compare this with the part from the X1 on the left, you can see there is still

133
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,140
 some VFA's.

134
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,040
 It's kind of hard to see in the video, but I can definitely see them in person.

135
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,160
 I would say both of these are good parts, very usable.

136
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,220
 And I don't think either of them look bad, which is important, especially considering

137
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,700
 I'm just using default settings.

138
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,560
 One thing I do want to note is that I couldn't get a completely non-worked part off the

139
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:38,940
 X1.

140
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,060
 You can see it pretty clearly on the left corner there that it's warping up.

141
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,720
 Here, we're comparing to a part off of the CD plus 4 on the left.

142
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,200
 And both of these parts have very consistent extrusion.

143
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,920
 And that is something that I noted on my plus 4 review.

144
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,980
 You can see it's very smooth here on the sides.

145
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,600
 But I still can see VFA's in both of these parts.

146
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,380
 You can see it right here.

147
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,540
 Like I said, with the X1, it's a lot more obvious in person.

148
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,660
 Here's another part from the Core 1.

149
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,820
 And again, this didn't warp at all.

150
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,000
 I know that you can still kind of see a little bit of light under the ruler.

151
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,140
 And maybe there is a slight bit of warping, but from what I can tell, what I can feel in

152
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,320
 my hands, there really is no warping.

153
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,040
 You can see some nice consistent extrusion.

154
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,300
 It handled the overhangs over here pretty well.

155
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,140
 Overall, I'm pretty impressed with this part.

156
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,100
 For this next section, I just want to show you guys what it's like to actually run a

157
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,440
 print on this thing from start to finish.

158
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,920
 So, the first thing I did is clean my build plate.

159
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,620
 And then we're going to do this print in TPU, which is notoriously kind of difficult

160
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,720
 on some extruders.

161
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,560
 I went ahead and printed this straight from the dry box, since TPU also is very moisture-absorbing.

162
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,140
 So I just feed my filament up from the side.

163
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,480
 Doing this one-handed and trying to hold a camera so it's a little difficult.

164
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,480
 Once the printer detects that there's filament, it starts to insert it, and then we just

165
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,940
 kind of wait for it to extrude.

166
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,600
 Even though this is TPU, I didn't have any issues, the next reader grabbed it and just

167
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,040
 fed it through.

168
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:19,200
 Jumping into the slicer, I have this model that I wanted to print in TPU, it's a little

169
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,700
 cable tie.

170
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,600
 I have my print setting selected in the structural profile.

171
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,240
 The only changes I made were cubic instead of grid.

172
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,200
 Filament, I have St. Smart TPU loaded, which is exactly what I'm printing.

173
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,100
 And then I have core one selected, and I didn't change anything.

174
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,180
 We'll slice it.

175
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,320
 Send to connect.

176
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,580
 We can see my printer.

177
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,820
 It's idle, I'll select it, and then send and start print.

178
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:46,880
 And it's sent.

179
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:47,700
 It's that easy.

180
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,960
 Turning around to my printer here, it starts downloading almost instantly, and then

181
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,520
 we're off printing.

182
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,320
 Good to watch the first layer go down, and I don't see any issues with this first layer,

183
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,460
 it's looking really good to me.

184
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:06,880
 I don't see any obvious signs of stringing yet, even though it's TPU, I did dry the filament,

185
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,060
 but yeah.

186
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,260
 And here we have the finalized print.

187
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,560
 It did end up actually stringing just a little bit, which is probably just a case of me

188
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,060
 needing to dry the filament a little more.

189
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,760
 And the final product works out really well, and it's organized on my cables.

190
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,160
 Outside of that, I do have a diamond back nozzle that I installed on my printer, and I

191
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,760
 printed some of this ARI1 PETG glass fiber, which turned out amazing.

192
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,440
 Here it is compared to a print off of one of my Vorons, and this filament is nice because

193
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,120
 it does kind of hide some of the imperfections, which all infused filaments kind of do, but

194
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,720
 it came out great on the core one, and I had no fuss doing an infused filament on this

195
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,020
 printer.

196
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,840
 Then I just started printing stuff.

197
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,760
 I printed the bonkers benchy that prints in about eight minutes.

198
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,520
 I did these boxes in PLA.

199
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,300
 I did some fidgets.

200
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,580
 I printed this knife model in PETG.

201
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,120
 Everything was going great.

202
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,060
 And then I tried this trash can model, and this happened.

203
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,480
 This is the first time I've ever had a print be so stuck to a plate that it ripped the

204
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,340
 bottom layers off trying to remove it from the plate.

205
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,020
 I'm going to chalk this one up as a fluke because nothing has happened like that before

206
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,180
 or since, although it was a bit strange and I was going to let you guys know about it.

207
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,120
 But there you have it folks.

208
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,980
 The core one has been an awesome printer and an awesome addition to my small fleet of

209
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,200
 printers.

210
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,660
 It seems to handle all the different types of filament that I can throw at it, and Prusa

211
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:35,940
 Connect has been a breeze to use, especially now that I upgraded my Mark IV to a Mark IV

212
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,600
 S, and I can use it with that too.

213
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,360
 Hopefully you guys got a sense of how this thing really performs, and you can use it to

214
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,840
 make an informed decision on if you want to pick one up.

215
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,880
 I personally couldn't recommend it enough, and remember absolutely nobody is paying me

216
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,300
 to say that.

217
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,040
 So let me know your guys' thoughts down in the comments.

218
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,460
 And remember, it doesn't matter which printer you pick, as long as you subscribe because

219
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,580
 your prints will always come out, but very smooth.

220
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,000
 I'll see you guys in the next one.
